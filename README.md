# workDay_Scheduler
Description:
This repository holds files for a day planner. When deployed, user is presented with the current date, time and a 9am-5pm schedule with color coding to show past, present and future times. The user can input tasks to complete on the hour of choice.

Features:
This application gives the user a form to complete for their work day to keep track of their daily activities and responsibilities. The planner is also color coded to show the user past, present and future times. Past events will be colored in grey, present in red and future in green. When saving the todo items, they are stored locally and to the planner itself, allowing the users information to persist upon refresh of the browser. The clock and calendar also show current date and time, down to the second and continuously updates the time in 1000 millisecond intervals.
